fprintd (1.94.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control: depend on polkitd instead of policykit-1
    fprintd requires polkitd but it uses it via dbus. (Closes: #1025558)
  * debian/rules: Skip pam tests as they are timeouting in debian.
    This is a build failure that we've in debian but not upstream, so while
    we figure out what it is, it's better to just skip the tests to unblock
    fprintd to land.
  * debian/patches: Cherry pick upstream fixes

fprintd (0.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Do not add libpam-fprintd to the common-auth PAM service, existing
    installation shouldn't be affected. This will also mitigate bug #719004,
    adding the module to common-auth by default doesn't sound like a good idea
    in the first place as further configuration is probably needed anyway.
